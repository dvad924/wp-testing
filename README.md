Create psychological tests/quizzes with scales connected to results through simple formulas like "extraversion > 50%"

## Description ##

Create typical or advanced psychological tests (quizzes, assessments) with **questions** and **answers**. A respondent answers and receives **results**.

What's inside? **Scales** associated with the particular answer by **scores**. **Simple formulas** like `extraversion > 50%` upon calculation give you **results**.

### Respondent can ###

* View published test at homepage or at its own URL
* Pass the test by answering all questions' answers
* Run the test in single page or by one question per step
* See the passing progress in browser's title
* Get own individual results after running the test on standalone page, share them


### Logged-in respondent can ###

* View passing history in personal area


### Test author can ###

* Create and edit test in test editor like post editor
* Manage related and needed for test scales/results/global answers
* Edit results/scales descriptions (visual mode possible with the help of `visual-term-description-editor` plugin)
* View and filter tests passings
* Reorder scales/results/global answers
* Edit formulas with formulas editor
* Use total scores by scale as formula variable: extraversion > 50%
* Use  concrete question's answer as formula variable: question_5_1 OR question_9_7.
* Quick fill questions from text and scores from combination of scales/answers
* Customize test page options


### Long story ###

Edit scales, results and categories through **wordpress standard editors**, like categories editor. Associate them in sidebar. Change test questions, answers and formulas in standard wordpress metaboxes, below content. Reorder them if you like drag-n-drop.

At the top of content editor there are **buttons for quick access** to those metaboxes: Add New Questions, Edit Questions and Scores, Edit Formulas. If you want more control, you may add to them HTML tags like: headers, lists, images, hr and "read more" tag taken from post editor.

**Answers**  can be global to test — when all questions have the same answers. For example: "Yes", "No", "I'm not sure". Or you can use **individual answers** to add individual answer to each question. And the third way is to use global answers, but individualize their titles: not just "Yes", but "Yes, I do so and so", when you use it for the particular question. Some tests have this pattern.

Simple **formulas editor** has buttons for each scale (with sum of it's scores), question/answer button and allowed comparisions/operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `=>`, `<>`, `AND`, `OR`, `( .. )`, `NOT ( .. )`, `+`, `-`, `*`,  `/`.

Tests are like posts — they appear on home page and inside their categories pages if selected. But if you don't want your test to appear on home page, you can uncheck **"Publish on the home page"** in "Publish" metabox and this test will not appear on homepage.

**Quick fill** for questions and scores minimizes author's time. You can **quick fill questions from text** and they will fill appropriate fields. Same way you can **Quick fill scores** in many questions some answer+scale combination.

Respondent will get **results** on it's own individual passing page, which will allow share it. Logged-in respondent can see own results in admin area above the "Profile" page. There will be table with columns like: passing number, link, test, scales, results and date. It's possible to search/sort by test and date columns.

**Passings** are saved in DB with respondent's ip and device unique identifier. They are shown at "Respondents' results" table under "Tests" menu. It allow to see if someone will have many passings from same computer/smartphone/another device, which scales/results respondent have for concrete passing and ability to open it from there. If respondent was a logged in user — then you will see it in "Username" column with a link to profile. "Respondents' results" can be searched/sorted by most of it's columns. You can setup which columns you want to see there and how many passings per page you want to see.

**Test** page can be customized: reset answers on "Back" button, use your own caption for "Get Test Result" button, allow multiple answers per question, show percentage of answered questions and show one question per page.
**Results** page also can be customized: when you need to show/hide scales or test description on it; when you want to show scales chart or sort scales by scores sum.

Plugin localized into many languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Bulgarian, Italian, Turkish, Chinese, Brazilian, Spanish, Persian, Czech, Slovak, Thai, Arabic, Romanian, Greek and Russian. English, French, Dutch, Bulgarian, Italian, Turkish, Chinese, Brazilian, Spanish, Persian, Czech, Slovak, Thai, Arabic, Romanian, Greek, Polish and Russian have good quality (native speakers) — others need review. You can easily add your language through excellent [Transifiex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-testing/) service. **Translators** and *reviewers* are kindly welcome! See http://wp-translations.org/join/ for instructions.

**Quality** and **compatibility** are taken really seriously. Plugin tested on [more than 30 combinations](https://travis-ci.org/garex/wp-testing) of WordPress (from 3.2 to latest) and PHP (from 5.2 to 7.0) plus three custom combinations: for old MySQL storage engine (MyISAM), with few popular plugins and in [multisite mode](https://circleci.com/gh/garex/wp-testing/tree/develop). So you can be sure, that it will just work, even if you don't have the latest WordPress or your hosting doesn't have the latest versions of PHP/MySQL. [Build status image](https://travis-ci.org/garex/wp-testing.svg?branch=develop) is available.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Plugin is not works or works improperly ###

Most possibly it's a conflict with your current theme or some of other plugin.
To check it — try to switch theme to default WP theme and see if it helps.
In case of plugins conflict try to disable other plugins one by one and check. Or disable all of them and check — it will help to understand if problem is on other plugins side.

### I see some "Fatal error: bla-bla-bla" ###

Try to find there phrases like "Class ... not found" or "Call to undefined function ...". If it's the case — then your current hoster has disabled some PHP extension. Contact with your hosting company to enable them. Most popular missing extension is "mysqli".

### How to start? Where is documentation? ###

See the video, screenshots and example test. We will not plan to create any documentation. For complex test logic [paid support](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eHQB69neQJ68xl3vT-x4cHERZTBskq2L0x47AjUPyKM/edit?usp=sharing) is available.

### Shortcodes? ###

**wpt_tests** — the list of tests. Attributes (allowed values): sort/reverse (id, title, created, modified, status, name, comments), max (number), id (numbers separated by commas), list (values for CSS `list-style-type`), class (any CSS class name).

**wpt_test_read_more** — the title of test, text before "more" and "Start Test" button. Attributes (allowed values): id/name (id or name or your test), start_title (any text), class (any CSS class name).

### Wonderful, but I want to have this, that and those feature in plugin ###
