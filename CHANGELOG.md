### 0.18.4 ###

Improve results saving under high concurrent load

* Issue solved by catching such errors and restarting save as recommended at [MySQL :: How to Cope with Deadlocks](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-deadlocks.html)

You should upgrade only if your site is popular and you've heard of some strange "white screens of death" when respondents are posting their results on last step before redirecting to result pages.

Just opening result page many times will not result in any errors.
Especially if you have some cache plugin, that already transformed result page into static page and DB is not touched at all.

For reporting and sponsoring this issue thanks to [Johan](http://www.personalityperfect.com/)

Really-multisite, menu for non-admins and migration fault tolerance

Plugin now really multisite-compatible

* When "Network Activate" is used — database updated for all sites
* When new site created, it's database also updated

Correctly add menu page under non-admin

* Respect user role when adding menu
* Rename page title to "My Test Results"

Improve migration fault tolerance when WordPress tables has different table types

* Normally you should have only single table type (name if format, engine): MyISAM or InnoDB
* But there are cases when you have "damaged" or "optimized" database and table types differs
* Now database migration takes this into account. It's critical only for new users when they can't activate plugin
* Thanks to paid support — this issue was catched during it


### 0.17.2 ###

Add intro-video with plugin description, howto concepts and explanations: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT3d8Jdm7kY

### 0.17.1 ###

Fix incorrect content processing

Symptoms:

* Shortcodes don't work on result page

Upgrade notice:

* If you use version 0.17 upgrade to this version!
* Please check first pages of all tests, that use shortcodes in them
* Also please check  result pages, which could have shortcodes inside.
It's ok just  to open at least one existing page. Shortcodes could be in results or scales descriptions.

I apologize for the inconvenience.


### 0.17 ###

Shortcodes for tests embedding

* Add `wpt_test_read_more` and `wpt_test_first_page` shortcodes that allows to embed test in short or full modes.
* Enrich parameters of `wpt_tests` shortcode (ex-`wptlist`).
* Hide "Publish on homepage" checkbox when it's impossible to publish on homepage (custom page on home instead of latests posts).

For details about shortcodes params please see our good old FAQ.

### 0.16 ###

Decimalize scores

Before score value could be from -128 to 127, which is not too usable for tests which have decimal scores. Now it's changed and possible values are from -999.999 to 999.999. So now you can use scores like 0.005 or else. These changes are applied to scales's labels too.
Decimal-style values are shown only when it's needed. So if you have scale which values are 15 out of 15, it will be shown as "15 out of 15". But when values will be decimal — it will  be shown as decimal: "12.034 out of 24.3".

* WordPress compatibility updated to 4.2.4 and prepared to 4.3.
* Use [semantic headers](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/) in respondents results as of WP 4.3.

* Respect results orders. Helpful when you have many results and their output order is important at results page.
* Fix support tags generation.

Internal improvements:

* Step strategy know if answered questions are possible now.
* Step strategy can show step's description as a short description before questions.


### 0.15.2 ###

Maintenance: Document "Plugin update checker" library role

Wp-testing plugin uses external library named "Plugin Update Checker" for the purposes of updating paid addons only. These addons are hosted at http://apsiholog.ru/addons/. Updates happens only in admin area and only when addon registered. So it's not touched you if you dont' have any paid addon installed. This external library is not send anything to update server other than the current version of paid addon, that needs to be updated when it's time will comes.

Upgrade notice:

### 0.15 ###

Add question-answer variables in formulas

* Link results without scales and scores — only questions and answers needed
* Add NOT comparisions in formulas
* Warn about required answers in more understandable way

In formulas now there is button titled "Question [..] answer [..]" that on click adds variable like `question_1_answer_2`. This variable will be true only when respondent will choose in 1st question 2nd answer.

Before when you have two opposite results and you was enforced to negate their formulas manually. For example: `scale-1 > scale-2 AND scale-1 < scale-3` for 1st result and opposite `scale-1 <= scale-2 OR scale-1 >= scale-3`.
Now you can do it without moving your mind on 2nd: `NOT(scale-1 > scale-2 AND scale-1 < scale-3)`.
